# Autark â€“ A self-contained build system for C/C++

**Autark is a lightweight build system for C/C++ projects that requires only the `dash` shell and a `cc` compiler to work!**
The project build script `build.sh` automatically initializes the Autark build system. From that point on, your project is built using Autark.
Autark handles both internal and external project dependencies much more precisely and cleanly than is typically done with Make or CMake.
Build rules are defined using a specialized DSL in Autark files, which is mostly declarative in nature.


Documentation will be available in the very near future.
